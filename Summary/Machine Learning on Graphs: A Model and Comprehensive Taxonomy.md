# Machine Learning on Graphs: A Model and Comprehensive Taxonomy

## Background
Graph representation learning (GRL) falls into three categories:
1. network embedding: learning unsupervised representations of relational structure.
2. graph regularized neural networks: leverages graphs to augment neural network losses with a regularization objective (semi-supervised learning).
3. graph neural networks: aims to learn differentiable functions over discrete topologies with arbitrary structure.

   
## Main idea
Provide a toxonomy for GRL, provide a bring btw three categories of GRL: network embedding, graph regularization and graph neural networks; and propose "GRAPHEDM framework", which generalizes popular algorithms for semi-supervised and unsupervised learning of graph representations into a single consistent approach
