# Machine Learning on Graphs: A Model and Comprehensive Taxonomy

## Background

While graph-structured representation could model a complex relational data structure, its characteristics impose challenges such as defining structural prior, and ordering of nodes. 

Geometric deep learning methods apply deep learning technique to non-euclidian data, makes them suitable for graph-structured data. One of these methods is graph representation learning (GRL).  

GRL could be divided into two categories
- supervised: aims at learning low-dimensional Euclidean representations that preserve the structure of an input graph. 
- unsuprevised: also learns low-dimensional Euclidean representations, but for a specific downstream prediction task such as node or graph classification.

GRL falls into three categories:
1. network embedding: learning unsupervised representations of relational structure.
2. graph regularized neural networks: leverages graphs to augment neural network losses with a regularization objective (semi-supervised learning).
3. graph neural networks: aims to learn differentiable functions over discrete topologies with arbitrary structure.


   
## Main idea
Provide a toxonomy for GRL, a bridge btw three categories of GRL: network embedding, graph regularization and graph neural networks; and propose "GRAPHEDM framework", which generalizes popular algorithms for semi-supervised and unsupervised learning of graph representations into a single consistent approach
