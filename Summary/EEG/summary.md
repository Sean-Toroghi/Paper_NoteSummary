| DTP-NET: LEARNING TO RECONSTRUCT EEG SIGNALS IN TIME-FREQUENCY DOMAIN BY MULTI-SCALE FEATURE REUSE
 |  EEG - Preprocessing: de-noising the EEG signals    | Employ CNN architecture:  consists of a Densely Connected Temporal Pyramid (DTP) sandwiched between a pair of learnable time-frequency transformations for end-to-end electroencephalogram (EEG)
denoising. The proposed method first transforms a single-channel EEG signal of arbitrary length into the time-frequency domain via an Encoder layer. Then, noises, such as ocular and muscle artifacts, are extracted by DTP in a multi-scale fashion and reduced. Finally, a Decoder layer is employed to reconstruct the artifact-reduced EEG signal.        |      |
